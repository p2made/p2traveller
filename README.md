# p2traveller - OpenWrt Travel Router

My adventures setting up a custom travel router with [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/). A collection of OpenWrt configuration files & gists.

My initial router is a [TP-Link](https://www.tp-link.com/au/) [TL-WR902AC v3](https://www.tp-link.com/au/home-networking/wifi-router/tl-wr902ac/), but that has proved insufficient for my demands. Under consideration are...

* [GL-E70 Mudi](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-e750/)* - has OpenWrt as factory firmware.
* [GL-XE300 Puli](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-xe300/)* - has OpenWrt as factory firmware.
* [FileHub AC750](https://www.ravpower.com/products/rp-wd009-filehub) - is supported for OpenWrt.

\* **DO NOT** buy direct from their website. You may be hit with hidden charges. Instead use their [AliExpress store](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/5100113) or a trusted reseller of your choice.

**Update:** The GL-E70 Mudi is shown on AliExpress as discontinued (so why still have it listed?). I have re-ordered the GL-XE300 Puli via AliExpress.

## Major Objectives

1. Mobile hotspot - to get online wherever I happen to be.
2. China proof - unrestricted internet access in countries with heavy restrictions.
3. Time Machine - so I don't have to plug a drive into my Mac for backups.
4. LAMP stack - for my little bits of web development.
5. File server - as an aid to web development.

## Objectives/Wishlist Detail

1. one
2. two
3. three
4. four
5. five

## Steps Taken

1. [Flash OpenWrt to router](https://gist.github.com/p2made/c46602a4439f0263e3697e7f04a42e30) - not necessary on a router with OpenWrt pre-installed.
2. [Set up ExtRoot & swap](https://gist.github.com/p2made/4f38be302043d51fe2e08aa601a8d2e3) - probably not necessary on a more capable router.
3. Set up TravelMate - turns OpenWrt onto a travel router.
